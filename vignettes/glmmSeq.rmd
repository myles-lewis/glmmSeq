# glmmSeq 

<img src="https://katrionagoldmann.github.io/glmmSeq/logo.png" align="right" alt="glmmSeq logo" width="200" hspace="20" border="0"/>


The aim of this package is to model gene expression with a general linear mixed
model (GLMM). The most widely used mainstream differential gene expression analysis tools 
(e.g [Limma](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv007), [DESeq2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8), 
[edgeR](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616)) are all unable to fit 
mixed effects linear models. This package however fits negative binomial mixed 
effects models at individual gene level using the `negative.binomial` function
from `MASS` and the `glmer` function in 
[`lme4`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4) which enables random 
effect, as as well as mixed effects, to be modelled.

### Installing from CRAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("glmmSeq")
```


### Installing from Github

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("KatrionaGoldmann/glmmSeq")
```

### Installing Locally

Or you can source the functions individually:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
functions = list.files("./R", full.names = TRUE)
invisible(lapply(functions, source))
```

But you will need to load in the additional libraries:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install CRAN packages
invisible(lapply(c("MASS", "car", "ggplot2", "ggpubr", "lme4","lmerTest",
                   "methods", "parallel", "plotly", "pbapply", "pbmcapply"),
                 function(p){
                   if(! p %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
                     install.packages(p)
                   }
                   library(p, character.only=TRUE)
                 }))

# Install BioConductor packages
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
invisible(lapply(c("qvalue"), function(p){
  if(! p %in% rownames(installed.packages())) BiocManager::install(p)
  library(p, character.only=TRUE)
}))

```

# Overview

To get started, first we load in the package:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(glmmSeq)
set.seed(1234)
```


This vignette will demonstrate the power of this package using a minimal example
from the [PEAC data set](https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/). Here we focus on the
synovial biopsy RNA-Seq data from this cohort of patients with early rheumatoid
arthritis.

```{r}
data(PEAC_minimal_load)
```

This data contains:

- metadata: which describes each sample. Including patient ID, sample time-point,
and six-month EULAR response. Where 
[EULAR](https://www.das-score.nl/en/das-and-das28/das28-why/eular-response-criteria) 
is a rheumatoid arthritis response metric based on composite 
[DAS28 scores](https://www.das-score.nl/en/).
- tpm: the transcript per million RNA-seq count data

These are outlined in the following subsections.

## Metadata

```{r}
metadata$EULAR_binary  = NA
metadata$EULAR_binary[metadata$EULAR_6m %in%
                        c("Good", "Moderate" )] = "responder"
metadata$EULAR_binary[metadata$EULAR_6m %in% c("Non-response")] = "non_responder"

kable(head(metadata), row.names = F) %>% kable_styling()
```

## Count data

```{r}

kable(head(tpm)) %>% kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

## Dispersion

Using negative binomial models requires gene dispersion estimates to be made.
This can be achieved in a number of ways. A common way to calculate this for
gene _i_ is to use the equation:

<p style="text-align: center;">
Dispersion<sub>i</sub> = (variance<sub>i</sub> - mean<sub>i</sub>)/mean<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>
</p>

This can be calculated using:

```{r}
disp <- apply(tpm, 1, function(x){
  (var(x, na.rm=TRUE)-mean(x, na.rm=TRUE))/(mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)**2)
  })

head(disp)
```

Alternatively, we recommend using _edgeR_ to estimate of the common, trended and 
tagwise dispersions across all tags:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
disp  <- setNames(edgeR::estimateDisp(tpm)$tagwise.dispersion, rownames(tpm))

head(disp)
```

or with _DESeq2_ using the raw counts:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi, colData = metadata, design = ~ 1)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
dispersions <- setNames(dispersions(dds), rownames(txi$counts))
```


## Size Factors

There is also an option to include size factors for each gene. Again this can be 
estimated using:

```{r}
sizeFactors <- colSums(tpm)  
sizeFactors <- sizeFactors / mean(sizeFactors)  # normalise to mean = 1

head(sizeFactors)
```

Or using edgeR these can be calculated from the raw read counts: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sizeFactors <- calcNormFactors(counts, method="TMM")
```

Similarly, with DESeq2: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sizeFactors <- estimateSizeFactorsForMatrix(counts)
```

Note the `sizeFactors` vector needs to be centred around 1, since it used
directly as an offset of form `log(sizeFactors)` in the GLMM model.

# Fitting Models

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px; text-align:center;}
</style>

To fit a model for one gene over time we use a formula such as:

>  gene expression ~ fixed effects + random effects

In R the formula is defined by both the fixed-effects and random-effects part
of the model, with the response on the left of a ~ operator and the
terms, separated by + operators, on the right. Random-effects terms are
distinguished by vertical bars ("|") separating expressions for design matrices
from grouping factors. For more information see the `?lme4::glmer`.

In this case study we want to use time and response as fixed effects and the
patients as random effects:

<div class = "blue">
gene expression ~ time + response + (1 | patient)
</div>

To fit this model for all genes we can use the `glmmSeq` function. Note that
this analysis can take some time, with 4 cores:

- 1000 genes takes about 10 seconds
- 20000 genes takes about 4 mins

```{r, warning=FALSE}
results <- glmmSeq(~ Timepoint * EULAR_6m + (1 | PATID),
                   countdata = tpm,
                   metadata = metadata,
                   dispersion = disp,
                   progress = TRUE)
```

or alternatively using two-factor classification with EULAR_binary: 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
results2 <- glmmSeq(~ Timepoint * EULAR_binary + (1 | PATID),
                    countdata = tpm,
                    metadata = metadata,
                    dispersion = disp)
```

## Outputs

This creates a GlmmSeq object which contains the following slots:

```{r}
names(attributes(results))
```


The variables used by the model are in the `@modeldata`:

```{r}
kable(results@modelData) %>% kable_styling()
```

The model fit statistics can be viewed in the `@stats` slot which is a list of
items including fitted model coefficients, their standard errors and the results
of statistical tests on terms within the model using Wald type 2 Chi square. To
see the most significant interactions we can order `pvals` by
`Timepoint:EULAR_6m`:

```{r}
stats <- summary(results)

kable(stats[order(stats[, 'P_Timepoint:EULAR_6m']), ]) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

Summary statistics on a single gene can be shown specifying the argument `gene`.

```{r}
summary(results, gene = "MS4A1")
```

Estimated means based on each gene's fitted model to show fixed effects and
their 95% confidence intervals can be seen in the `@predict` slot:

```{r}
predict = data.frame(results@predict)
kable(predict) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

## Q-values

The q-values from each of the p-value columns can be calculated using
`glmmQvals`. This will print a significance table based on the cut-off (default
p=0.05) and add a matrix named `qvals` to the `@stats` slot:

```{r}
results <- glmmQvals(results)
```

# Gaussian mixed effects models

An alternative to fitting negative binomial GLMM is to use transformed data and
fit gaussian LMM. The `lmmSeq` function will fit many LMM across genes (or other
data) where random effects/mixed effects models are useful. For example,
gaussian normalised DNA methylation data can be analysed using this method. In
the example below the RNA-Seq gene expression data is log transformed so that it
is approximately Gaussian.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
logtpm <- log2(tpm + 1)
lmmres <- lmmSeq(~ Timepoint * EULAR_6m + (1 | PATID),
                   maindata = logtpm,
                   metadata = metadata,
                   progress = TRUE)
summary(lmmres, "MS4A1")
```

## Individual Genes

Similarly you can run the script for an individual gene (make sure you use 
`drop = FALSE` to maintain `countdata` as a matrix).

```{r, warning=FALSE}
MS4A1glmm <- glmmSeq(~ Timepoint * EULAR_6m + (1 | PATID),
                     countdata = tpm["MS4A1", , drop = FALSE],
                     metadata = metadata,
                     dispersion = disp,
                     verbose = FALSE)
```

The (g)lmer fitted object can be obtained using the function `glmmRefit()`:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
fit <- glmmRefit(results, gene = "MS4A1")
fit
```

These (g)lmer objects can be passed to other packages notably `emmeans` for
visualising estimated marginal means. Note these are based on the model, not
directly on the data.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(emmeans)

emmeans(fit, ~ Timepoint | EULAR_6m)
emmip(fit, ~ Timepoint | EULAR_6m)
```

# Model Plots

For variables such as time, which are matched according to an ID (the random
effect), we can examine the fitted model using plots which show estimated means
and confidence intervals based on coefficients for the fitted regression model,
overlaid upon the underlying data. In this case the samples are matched
longitudinally over time.

Plots can be viewed using either ggplot or base graphics. We can start looking 
at the gene with the most significant interaction _IGHV3-23_:

```{r, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
plotColours <- c("skyblue", "goldenrod1", "mediumseagreen")
modColours <- c("dodgerblue3", "goldenrod3", "seagreen4")
shapes <- c(17, 19, 18)

ggmodelPlot(results,
            geneName = "IGHV3-23",
            x1var = "Timepoint",
            x2var="EULAR_6m",
            xlab="Time",
            colours = plotColours,
            shapes = shapes,
            lineColours = plotColours, 
            modelColours = modColours,
            modelSize = 10)
```

Or using base graphics, with or without the model fit overlaid:

```{r, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
oldpar <- par(mfrow=c(1, 2))

modelPlot(results2,
          geneName = "FGF14",
          x1var = "Timepoint",
          x2var="EULAR_binary",
          fontSize=0.65,
          colours=c("coral", "mediumseagreen"),
          modelColours = c("coral", "mediumseagreen"),
          modelLineColours = "black",
          modelSize = 2)

modelPlot(results,
          geneName = "EMILIN3",
          x1var = "Timepoint",
          x2var = "EULAR_6m",
          colours = plotColours,
          addModel = FALSE)

par(oldpar)
```

To plot the model fits alone set `addPoints = FALSE`.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggpubr)

p1 <- ggmodelPlot(results,
                  "ADAM12",
                  x1var="Timepoint",
                  x2var="EULAR_6m",
                  xlab="Time",
                  addPoints = FALSE,
                  colours = plotColours)

p2 <- ggmodelPlot(results,
                  "EMILIN3",
                  x1var="Timepoint",
                  x2var="EULAR_6m",
                  xlab="Time",
                  fontSize=8,
                  x2Offset=1,
                  addPoints = FALSE,
                  colours = plotColours)

ggarrange(p1, p2, ncol=2, common.legend = T, legend="bottom")
```


## Fold Change Plots

The comparative fold change (for `x1var` variables) between conditions (`x2var`
and `x2Values` variables) can be plotted using an fcPlot for all genes to
highlight significance.

(By setting `graphics = "plotly"` this can be viewed interactively)

```{r}
# Genes to label:
labels = c('MS4A1', 'FGF14', 'IL2RG', 'IGHV3-23', 'ADAM12', 'IL36G', 
           'BLK', 'SAA1', 'CILP', 'EMILIN3', 'EMILIN2', 'IGHJ6', 
           'CXCL9', 'CXCL13')

fcPlot(results,
       x1var="Timepoint",
       x2var="EULAR_6m",
       x2Values=c("Good", "Non-response"),
       pCutoff=0.1,
       labels=labels,
       useAdjusted = FALSE,
       plotCutoff = 1)
```

Genes on the line of identity, such as _IGHJ6_, will have associations in the
same direction whereas genes along the opposing x=-y line have association in
_opposite_ directions, such as _ADAM12_. This allows us to pick out genes of
potential interest which we can have another closer look at:

```{r, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
p1<- ggmodelPlot(results,
                 geneName = "ADAM12",
                 x1var = "Timepoint",
                 x2var="EULAR_6m",
                 colours = "grey60",
                 modelColour = plotColours, 
                 modelLineColour =  plotColours) +
  theme(plot.subtitle=element_text(size=9))

p2 <- ggmodelPlot(results,
                  geneName = "IGHJ6",
                  x1var = "Timepoint",
                  x2var="EULAR_6m",
                  colours = "blue",
                  fontSize=8,
                  modelSize=0.1) +
  theme(plot.subtitle=element_text(size=9))

ggarrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```


## MA plots

An MA plot is an application of a Bland–Altman plot. The plot visualizes the
differences between measurements taken in two samples, by transforming the data
onto M (log ratio) and A (mean average) scales, then plotting these values.

```{r, fig.height=8}
maPlots <- maPlot(results,
                  x1var="Timepoint",
                  x2var="EULAR_6m",
                  x2Values=c("Good", "Non-response"),
                  colours=c('grey', 'midnightblue',
                             'mediumseagreen', 'goldenrod'),
                  labels=labels,
                  graphics="ggplot")

maPlots$combined
```
